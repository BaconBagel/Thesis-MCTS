A premade reward array can be downloaded here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HuAW3fRxHwwazk4GkmtCsztetCmj7_8s/view?usp=sharing jut replace the file path and run

The initialise value sets initilisation to the state (timestep, x coordinate, y coordinate) in the mcts function if set to 1, this will go through 100 timesteps

n_simulation sets the number of cycles before completion.

There are several other parameters that can be changed. such as walk length and walk behaviour, discount rate, sampling split, etc
